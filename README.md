# Teach Yourself: Materialize

## Why Materialize?

I selected Materialize to learn how to make responsive deisgn easier, in addition to its other features to make my site look more professional. I chose Materialize over Bootstrap because in our Bootstrap class earlier in the course, the guest lecturer mentioned that Materialize has newer designs that may not be quite as recognizable as Bootstrap. 

I have also heard from several of my classmates that they have used it and enjoyed working with it. Lawrence and Angelica incorporated Materialize into our Project 3. I didn't work much on the CSS portion of that project, so I also wanted to make sure I understood it so I can make some edits on the visual design of the site for my portfolio.

## What Does Materialize Solve?

Materialize makes sites look more polished and professional. It also makes responsive design much easier, ensuring your site is functional on all screen sizes without having to write multiple media queries yourself.

Instead of multiple lines of detailed CSS, I can use classes in my HTML and JS pages to change the UI of my site.

## Why Does One Use It?

Materialize is one of many design languages that help developers to design responsive sites. Not all developers are designers, so this tool is extremely helpful in making those who are more focused on the code to create sites that are pleasing to the eye and easy for the user to navigate.

There are other design languages available to developers, and it's just your own personal preference when selecting which one to use.

## History of Materialize

Materialize was created and in maintained by Google. Google's goal is to develop a system of design that allows for a unified user experience across all their products on any platform.

## My Opinion on Materialize

I love it! It was much easier than I was anticipating, and it makes the UI look great. I love the idea of never writing a media query. As I implement Materialize into my projects for my portfolio, it puts my mind at ease that poetential employers will be navigating a product that is polished and professional.

## Conceptual Hurdles

Materialize is pretty straight forward. Before using it myself, I was curious how I would combine Materialize with CSS. The class and id functionality make it a seamless process.
